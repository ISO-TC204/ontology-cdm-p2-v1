# City Resident Pattern

This ontology specifies the city-level concepts for the city resident pattern of the city data model. As different cities have different definitions of who is that city's Resident, the City Resident Pattern must contain the properties required by each.  Central to all of the definitions is the concept of residing. Variously referred to as a home or domicile in which the resident spends significant amounts of time.  They may own it, rent it or just stay in it.  Legally, “reside means to dwell permanently or continuously. It expresses an idea that a person keeps or returns to a particular dwelling place as his fixed, settled, or legal abode. The meaning of reside implies a continuous arrangement” ; reside has both a temporal and spatial dimension. The city of Toronto's definition of a city resident includes the concept of owning property or owning or operating a business in the city. For Beijing, nationality is a unique aspect.
