# Transport Infrastructure Pattern

This ontology specifies the city-level concepts for the transport infrastructure pattern of the city data model. The Transportation Infrastructure pattern defines the concepts that are relevant in describing the physical transportation infrastructure and their characteristics. This includes the concepts of a Road, Bridge, and Tunnel. The Infrastructure Pattern is reused here, as these transportation structures are all defined as types of (subclasses) Infrastructure Elements.

This pattern imports the following patterns:

- [Infrastructure Pattern](InfrastructurePattern.md)

This pattern consists of the following classes:

- [Bridge](Bridge.md)
- [Bridge Segment](BridgeSegment.md)
- [Rail Line](RailLine.md)
- [Rail Link](RailLink.md)
- [Rail Segment](RailSegment.md)
- [Road](Road.md)
- [Road Link](RoadLink.md)
- [Road Network Type](RoadNetworkType.md)
- [Road Segment](RoadSegment.md)
- [Transport Infrastructure Thing](TransportInfrastructureThing.md)
- [Travelled Way](TravelledWay.md)
- [Travelled Way Link](TravelledWayLink.md)
- [Travelled Way Segment](TravelledWaySegment.md)
- [Tunnel](Tunnel.md)
- [Tunnel Segment](TunnelSegment.md)

The formal definition of this pattern is available in [OWL Syntax](TransportInfrastructurePattern.owl).
