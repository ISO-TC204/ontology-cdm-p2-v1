# Building Pattern

This ontology specifies the city-level concepts for the building pattern of the city data model. A Building is a structure with some location in the urban system. The location of the Building in space may change due to construction, but the Parcel/Lot of land it is located on cannot. There may be many different types (subclasses) of buildings, such as House, Apartment Building, Office Building, and so on.

This pattern imports the following patterns:

- [Infrastructure Pattern](InfrastructurePattern.md)

This pattern consists of the following classes:

- [Area Ratio](AreaRatio.md)

- [Building Unit](BuildingUnit.md)
- [Building Use](BuildingUse.md)
- [Construction Status](ConstructionStatus.md)
- [Facility](Facility.md)
