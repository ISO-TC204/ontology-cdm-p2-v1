This ontology specifies the city-level concepts for the infrastructure pattern of the city data model. The Infrastructure pattern defines the concepts needed to capture various types of city infrastructure, such as buildings and roads. The Infrastructure pattern reuses the Spatial Location pattern (from ISO 5087-1) in order to capture the location of these infrastructure elements.

This pattern imports the following patterns:

- [Contact Pattern](ContactPattern.md)

This pattern consists of the following classes:

- [Infrastructure Element](InfrastructureElement.md)
- [Infrastructure Thing](InfrastructureThing.md)

The formal definition of this pattern is available in [OWL Syntax](InfrastructurePattern.owl).
