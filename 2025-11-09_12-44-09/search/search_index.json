The main difference between a by-law and a law passed by a national/federal or regional/state body is that a by-law is made by a non-sovereign body, which derives its authority from another governing body, and can only be made on a limited range of matters. A local council or municipal government derives its power to pass laws through a law of the national or regional government which specifies what things the town or city may regulate through by-laws. It is therefore a form of delegated legislation.\u201d (Wikipedia, 2020) \u201cA municipal by-law is no different than any other law of the land, and can be enforced with penalties, challenged in court and must comply with higher levels of law. Municipal bylaws are often enforceable through the public justice system, and offenders can be charged with a criminal offence for breach of a bylaw.\u201d (Alberta, 2017) The intent of the Bylaw ontology is to capture the major components of a city bylaw, such as dates, geographic areas of application, penalties, etc. It is not intended to provide a legal semantics with which to codify a particular bylaw. The following three types of bylaws are represented in the Bylaw Ontology (Alberta, 2017):  1.  Main bylaws;  2.  Amending bylaws, which reflect material changes, in principle or substance, to an existing bylaw; and  3.

A local council or municipal government derives its power to pass laws through a law of the national or regional government which specifies what things the town or city may regulate through by-laws. It is therefore a form of delegated legislation.\u201d (Wikipedia, 2020) \u201cA municipal by-law is no different than any other law of the land, and can be enforced with penalties, challenged in court and must comply with higher levels of law.
