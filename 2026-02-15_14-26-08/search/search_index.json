In city data there are many classes of things that are intended to be instantiated using a set list of values (e.g., classification systems), however these values may change based on application or context.          The Code Pattern introduces a generic set of classes and properties that can be used to extend such classes to define various classification systems in an integrated way. Instead of enumerating value sets for classes, values can be defined with an associated Code that specifies additional metadata about the value and its origins.</p> <p>This ontology consists of the following patterns:</p> <p>The formal definition of these patterns is available in OWL Syntax.</p>"},{"location":"#untitled-ontology_5","title":"Untitled Ontology","text":"<p>This ontology specifies the city-level concepts for the person pattern of the city data model.</p> <p>This ontology consists of the following patterns:</p> <p>The formal definition of these patterns is available in OWL Syntax.</p>"},{"location":"#untitled-ontology_6","title":"Untitled Ontology","text":"<p>This ontology specifies the city-level concepts for the organization pattern of the city data model.

They may own it, rent it or just stay in it.  Legally, \u201creside means to dwell permanently or continuously. It expresses an idea that a person keeps or returns to a particular dwelling place as his fixed, settled, or legal abode. The meaning of reside implies a continuous arrangement\u201d ; reside has both a temporal and spatial dimension.
